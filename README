Makefile rules:

make test:
makes and runs all tests (separated into multiple files for each class, so it couldn't be named SkipBo.cpp)

make SkipBo:
Creates an executable called SkipBo-> when run, this makes a Game instance and allows for a user to play the game


We have implemented ALL of the required features and options for the project, including:
-operator overloading (in Deck and Card)
-class composition (Pile has-a vector of Cards, Player has-a Hand, Player has-a vector of [discard] Piles etc)
-inheritance (Person is-a Player and Computer is-a Player; Deck is-a Pile, Hand is-a Pile etc)
-abstract base classes (Player is an abstract base class for Person and Computer)
-data encapsulation (private and protected members in Card, Pile, Game and Player)
-exception handling (invalid moves are one of the places we use exception handling)
-code reuse

Additionally, our code is clean, efficient, and readable.


We have also improved the AI (for extra credit) beyond legal random moves.  The AI functions at nearly the same level as a human player,
and it will choose a move that best serves to deplete its following piles in order:
1. Stack (or stock)
2. Hand
3. Discard

It will only discard as a last resort, when it is unable to play to a build pile.


The general flow of the game (in our code) is as follows:
- The Game is initialized.  UserInterface::mainMenu() is called, and the members of the Game are populated with information from the user. 
At this time, the user is able to create a new game or load a previously saved game from a file.

- Game repeatedly calls player.move() on the first player until the player discards.  In player.move(), the user is asked to input a move,
and the move is either executed or an exception is thrown based on the validity of the move.

- Once the player has played a discard move (player.move() will return false), we do the same thing for the next player (and so on and so forth).

- When a player's stack (or stock) pile has run out, the end game screen is shown, and the user is prompted to start a new game, or to quit.
